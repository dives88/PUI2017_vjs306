LESSON LEARNED: Never again last minute. 

Assignment 1:  Given that this was 'the easiest' I left it to the very last, unfortunately that was when github was down so I couldn't complete. After I was able to assess my peer's HO and HA I did find he did not construct them properly. Rather than being the complement of one another they were the same but with different words. (ie. saying from a binary outcome that is equal to 0 , and then saying it is not 1, they are stating the same. 

My comments and review were pushed to the original github directory:
PUI2017_grv232/HW3_grv232/CitibikeReview_vjs306.md

Assignment 2:

I worked with Kent and Alex on this one.  We each took 1 statistical analysis, found an article and discussed. In my case it was the Chi squared

Assignment 3:
I worked with Srikanth on this one. We formulated the null hypothesis for the convicted fellons. It was tricky to be careful we wording it.

Following the tables was relatively easy. Most of the time was spend understanding the H0 and HA. 

It was reassuring to see that we got the same results. And also that Z test and ChiSquare both rejected our Null Hypothesis


Assignment 4:
This was the Assignment I started first, with Matt, Davey and Charlie. The mechanical part (python) was relatively easy for the first section, what I struggled and spent a lot of time on was on understanding the Statistics behind it. On the coding I found out how to get the specific hour and determine in a condition if above or below a threshold it was night or day.

On the statistics I noticed the same for several of the classmates but they did a much better job in moving on while I kept fixating on furhter understanding. This was also detrimental for me to submit earlier. Another lesson learned. And more so I still want to understand better the statistics. 

Finally to determine the borough I found that geopy has a reverse function tand using it and reading from a dictionary I could determine the borough. However, in essence of time I kept the team's, specifically Matt, structure and code to use coordinate thresholds.
