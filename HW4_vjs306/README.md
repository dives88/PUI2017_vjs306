I worked with Kent and Alex on this one.  We each took 1 statistical analysis, found an article and discussed. In my case it was the Chi squared

Assignment 3:
I worked with Srikanth on this one. We formulated the null hypothesis for the convicted fellons. It was tricky to be careful we wording it.

Following the tables was relatively easy. Most of the time was spend understanding the H0 and HA. 

It was reassuring to see that we got the same results. And also that Z test and ChiSquare both rejected our Null Hypothesis
