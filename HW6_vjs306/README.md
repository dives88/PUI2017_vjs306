For homework 6 I worked on Sunday with Matt, Tarek, Sam, Sarah and Davey.  The Data Facility was completely down so we each had to work on our locals. Even though we were all nearby I was able to do much of the cleanup of the Dataframes by myself. Davey did provide input that creating a new DF only with the needed columns was faster. 

On Monday I worked closely with Kent and we created the squared model together. Plotting it took us a long time and we took advise from Andrew and John that were working nearby. Taking the logs if the dataframe and storing them on another dataframe and THEN doing the model on that made the trick.
