For Homework 8 I searched for a DataSet that helped understand a problem that could possibly be resolved by some means of technology. This lead me to the transportation and public safety areas and I found the NYPD Motor Vehicle Collisions dataset:

https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions/h9gi-nx95

As a start, and for the purpose of this homework I isolated specifically by Cyclist Fatalities, hoping to not only to learn from the observations but hopefully this area of study could lead to observe a pattern that can then be addressed. For example, what if there is a particular area or avenue that has more accidents and perhaps further studies could indicate a different traffic light syncronization could help, or going into future technologies what if we could connect cyclists to Autonomous vehicles in order to decrease accidents?   This of course is not the purpose of the homework, but might be an area to address for my paper. 

After selecting my dataset and while I was using CARTO for the visualization I found an interesting article from the LA times: 
http://www.latimes.com/opinion/livable-city/la-ol-livable-data-prevent-cycling-deaths-20151217-htmlstory.html .  I also found (as a non NY native) that the City of New York also has a Vision Zero program.   

The LA Times article was also helpful as it gave me the hint of utilizing the correct heat map and zoom to better represent the data. It was contrasting for example how the Upper East Side is practically clean whether in Brooklyn and the Lower side of Manhattan appear to have selective and recurring avenues. 

Last, but not least, it was interesting to observe an outlier, not necesarily (only) for Cyclists but fatalities in general, the dataset contains the tragic events of 10/31. 

Overall I think exploring more of this datates or related ones could provide useful insight in order to obtain Vision Zero.
