# PUI2017_vjs306

This is my github repository for __PUI2017__.  It took a few tries but I am getting better. 

_Below are the details for HW1 assignment_
_Note: screenshots and HW1_2 are in the separate folder as required

During Thursday session I was able to follow along, but not reproduce it on my side as I did not have a github account just yet. 

On Sunday noon several of us on the evening session met to work on the assignment. This worked well as it was a small group of part time students so we feel identified. It consisted of Tarek, Matt, Srikant, Imran, Davey and myself. Not all of us were present at the same time, and we all progressed at different speeds but it was very helpful to help and learn from each other. We were very clear the goal was to get Assignment's 1 and 2, and just work on the EC afterwards. 

In particular for __me__ I got as far as to complete the ___Assignment 1___ my repository, the lab, including messing with Davey's, Tarek's and Imran's repositories, we worked kind of in a circle. I also got to create a very basic readme. I also started on ___Assingment 2___ and configure my bash profile. It took several hours, mainly because on _Assignment 1_ I kept getting errors which at the time I didn't understand but they were mainly not entering the correct sequence for pull and then push new information.  Google saved the day. 

I also struggled on the github side after creating the repository, and running the command __git remote add origin__ followed by the github address I got some error about the branch not existing. After spending some time troubleshooting (entering commands as found in google) I assumed I had skipped some commands or followed a wrong order. I deleted the repository, started again and then just copy and pasted both commands and this time around it worked. 

For _Assignment 2_ modifying the bash profile to create the alias and environmental variable was no trouble. Uploading the screenshots was relatively easy and I did not face conflicts or error messages during the git add / commit / push.   At this time I decided it was a good time to break (it was Sunday night). 

On Tuesday evening a subset of us met again to continue work on _Assignment 3_ the extra credit. I am to the point that the code is working, but I need to upload to github, as well as pull Federica's file, in order to submit as requested and not just the code lines.  I will update this README file when that part is done.

On Wednesday evening I received feedback from the TA that my folder structure for this particular README and _Assignment 2_ was not correct so I came to fix that before completing the EC.
