# PUI2017_vjs306

This is my first ReadMe for the semester. It took several hours to understand the correct sequence to work with remote repositories. We worked in team and all were getting similar or sometimes different errors when following the directions both for Lab1 and HW1. It was a bit frustrating each error took several minutes 

 For me personally it took two tries, and the second one it made more sense. I got stuck for a couple of hours on the git remote add origin, and getting errors of origin and master not specified. I must have missed a prior git commit because when doing the steps again then I was succesful. 

Modifying the bash profile and alias was simple.
