_Below are the details for HW1 assignment_

Continuing now on to _Assignment 3:_

On Tuesday evening a subset of the Sunday team met again to continue work on _Assignment 3_ the extra credit. I got to the point to complete the code, but not in the format as required.

On Wednesday I dedicated the evening to that and I struggled to understand the instructions, for example using a different mu. I worked closely with Matt, and we got to the understanding that in order to have different means we would have to change the value inside the for loop. The charts looked different however than from other students. And I think it is due to the fact of the understanding of how to incorporate the different means.

If I have additional time I will attempt the challenge within the Assignment 3
