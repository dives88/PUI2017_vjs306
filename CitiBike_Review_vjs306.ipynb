    "## Review of Valeria's citibike exercise (VS306)\n",
    "\n",
    "**a. Are the null and alternative hypotheses correctly selected?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Valeria specifies her research question as follows: \"Female riders are more likely to be younger than male riders?\" This is a clear and interesting question. Having decided on the focus of the study, she sets a specific null nypothesis, namely:\n",
    "\n",
    "_\"Over the span of one month, the average age of female riders will be equal to or higher than the average age of male riders.\"_\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this research set-up, Valeria got the null and alternative hypothesis exactly correct. She labels them H0 and Ha, which is correct terminology for hypothesis testing. She specifies them in mathematical terms as follows:\n",
    "H0: $F_m >= M_m$\n",
    "Ha: $F_m < M_m$\n",
    "\n",
    "Significance level $\\alpha=0.05$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is correct research design because as it makes use of the principle of falsifiability as a way to draw conclusions. The test is to try and reject H0. If we cannot reject it, that falsifies our hypothesis that the age of female riders is lower on average. If we reject H0, then we still do not conclusively know that the hypothesis is true, but we know it's statistically credible at our chosen significance level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Things that were done correctly:\n",
    "* define a hypothesis in clear units that is measurable with available data. (Time span: one month, age in years.\n",
    "* select appropriate null and alternative hypotheses that cover the full set of scenarios ($F_m< M_m, F_m=M_m, F_m>M_m$)\n",
    "* specify the significance level. 0.05 is a standard and acceptable choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Things that could be done better:\n",
    "* not many improvements could be made, but it is suggested to specify the units (ie. years) in the hypothesis, as it is not actually spelt out.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "** b. does the data support the project? does it have the appropriate variables and pre-processing?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, the data supports the project. \n",
    "\n",
    "In field 7, Valeria dropped the unnecessary fields from the citibike data, which makes the code and output easier to follow. \n",
    "\n",
    "A key step was to create a new 'age' column, which is done by subtracting 'birth year' from 2017. A second important step is to create variables **fem_count** and **male_count** which are made from:\n",
    "* total females at each age / total females\n",
    "* total males at each age / total males\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is shown in histogram form in field 11. Interestingly, the percentage of women riders who age 24-27 is higher than for male riders. Conversely, a higher percentage of male riders are age 40+. So from visual inspection, the hypothesis already looks to be correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "**c. suggested test for H0**\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to test whether two means differ:\n",
    "* mean age of males\n",
    "* mean age of females\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, we are testing whether $M_m >= F_m$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore we need a test which is:\n",
    " - comparing two means against each other\n",
    " - a one-tailed test.\n",
    " \n",
    "The proposed test is a two-sample t-test. We meet the relevant conditions for using this test, since the two samples are randomly distributed from the larger population of active citibike members (they were selected based on the one-month period), and the sample size is large.\n",
    "\n",
    "The t test is calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$t= (\\bar{x_1} - \\bar{x_2}) - (\\mu_1 - \\mu_2) / {\\sqrt{s^2_p(\\frac{1}{n_1}+\\frac{1}{n_2})}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\bar{x_1}$ and $\\bar{x_2}$ are the sample means;\n",
    "$\\mu_1$ and $\\mu_2$ are the population means;\n",
    "$n_1$ and $n_2$ are the sample sizes;\n",
    "{s^2_p$ is the pooled variance; and\n",
    "$s^2_1$ and $s^2_2$ are the sample variances.\n",
    "\n",
    "The study can use a significance level: $\\alpha$ = 0.05.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to calculate the degrees of freedom for the study, which will be $n_1 + n_2 - 2$. Then we use a t table to look up the critical value for $\\alpha=0.05, df = (n_1 + n_2 -2)$. We call this $v_crit$. Note we are using the t statistic for a one-sided test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we calculate the test statistic, $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision rule:\n",
    "We reject H0 if $t > v_crit$.\n"
