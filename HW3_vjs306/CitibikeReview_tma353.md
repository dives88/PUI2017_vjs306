The Null and Alternative was done correctly. 

An appopriate statistical test for the data analysis would be a chi square test.
This is because the hypothesis is formulated to compare categorical data (gender) and their likeness (age) to one another. 

An interesting analysis with gender and age may be to use the same categories and compare to location and assumptions of incomes and racial background to attempt to identify if there are contributions to the gender age difference. Perhaps, there is an early adopter component or a lack of transportation equity influencing the gender age difference. Perhaps other months of data can be explored to see if gender and user age have an expected standard deviation that the initial analysis falls into.


# FBB  a test of means is appropriate here cause the IV is categorical but the DV is continuous (age) - ANOVA for example. but parametric tests may not be apprioriate

# FBB missing: was the data handled correctly and supported the question?
